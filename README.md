# Angular Project

## Dependencies

Angular and Angular Material UI are needed.

## Starting the server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Constraints

Focus on getting the UI to look like Figma mockup as close as *possible*.

- Angular Material is used for UI components.
- Not responsive in different screen sizes.
